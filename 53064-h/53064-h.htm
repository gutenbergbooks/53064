<p>Die-casting, a comparatively recent method for producing finished
castings, is rapidly proving itself an important factor in the economical
manufacture of interchangeable parts for adding machines, typewriters,
telephones, automobiles and numerous other products where it is essential
that the parts be nicely finished and accurate in dimensions.
The term “die-casting” is self-explanatory, meaning “to cast by means
of dies”; described briefly, the process consists of forcing molten metal
into steel dies, allowing it to cool in them, and then opening the dies
and removing the finished casting. It is the purpose of this treatise
to give a general outline of the die-casting process, showing its possibilities
and limitations, and also to give a description of the die-casting
machinery and its operation, of the fundamental principles involved,
and of the methods used in the die-making. Illustrative examples of
the best types of dies, based on results obtained from actual experience,
will also be given.</p>

<h3>Origin of Die Casting</h3>

<p>The origin of the die-casting process is somewhat difficult to ascertain.
We may look into the history of type founding and find that
away back in 1838, the first casting machine for type, invented by Bruce,
was a machine that involved the principles of die-casting as it is practiced
to-day. More recently, in 1885, Otto Mergenthaler brought out the
linotype machine. This machine is a good example of a die-casting
machine. However, as we interpret the word to-day, die-casting is a
broader term than type-casting or linotyping, although its development
without doubt is due to the success of the linotype machine. It is
doubtful if die-casting, properly speaking, was originated until about
fifteen years ago, and it is certain that it is only during the past few
years that the activities in this line have been very noticeable.</p>

<p>One of the first experiments in the direction of die-casting was undertaken
to get out some rubber mold parts cheaply enough to leave a
profit on a job that was beginning to look dubious from the financial
side. The molds were for making rubber plates about three inches
square and one-eighth inch thick, the top side of which was decorated
with fine raised scroll work; it was this latter feature that gave the
trouble. After wasting much time and money trying to stamp the
mold parts, a metal-tight box was made as shown in <a href="#Fig_1">Figs. 1 and 2</a>
with a block screwed in it, the purpose of which was to shape the mold
impression and impart to it the scroll design. As shown, the ends of
the box were removable, being screwed on. This box was placed under
a screw press and a straight plunger that just filled the top of the box
was fitted to the head of the press. After the two were lined up,
molten type metal was poured into the box, and as soon as the metal
had cooled to the “mushy” state, the ram of the press was forced down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
as shown in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 2</a>. Next, the ends of the box were removed, the screw
holding the block taken out, and the die-casting pushed from the box.
The object in having the inclined side to the box was to produce a piece
shaped with the proper inclination for its position in the final mold
used for casting the rubber plates. The illustrations give an idea of the
compression that took place. The die-casting was found to be sharp
at the corners and free from flaws, and the scroll work came up in fine
shape. Naturally the rest of the mold parts were made in the same
way and the job turned from failure into success.</p>

<p>From such simple experiments as these, the die-casting industry
has developed to its present stage. In view of the advances that have
been made in die-casting, it is singular that there are to-day only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
about a dozen concerns in the business in this country, but as the subject
becomes better understood, and the possibilities of the process are
realized, the demand for this class of castings will result in many
other firms going into the work, and it is not improbable that a large
number of factories will install die-casting plants of their own to aid
them in producing better work in a more economical way.</p>

<h3>Advantages, Possibilities and Limitations of Die Casting</h3>

<p>The greatest advantage of die-casting is the fact that the castings
produced are completely and accurately finished when taken from the
dies. When we say completely, we mean that absolutely no machining
is required after the piece has been cast, as it is ready to slip into its
place in the machine or device of which it is to be a part. When we
say accurately, we mean that each piece will come from the die an
exact counterpart of the last one; and if the dies are carefully made,
the castings will be accurate within 0.001 inch on all dimensions,
whether they are outside measurements, diameters of holes or radii.
All holes are cast and come out smoother than they could be reamed;
lugs and gear teeth are cast in place; threads, external and internal,
and of any desired pitch can be cast. Oil grooves can be cast in bearings,
and, in a word, any piece that can be machined can be die-cast.</p>

<p>The saving in machining works both ways; not only is all machine
work eliminated by the one operation of casting, but the machine tools
and the workmen necessary for their operation and up-keep are dispensed
with, the expense of building jigs and fixtures is stopped; and
no cutters, reamers, taps or drills are required for this branch of the
production. In addition, the labor required for operating the casting
machines may be classed as unskilled. No matter how intricate and
exacting the machine work on a piece has been, and how skillful a
workman was required to produce the work when machine-made, the
same result may be brought about by die-casting, and usually the work
is excelled, and, excluding the die-making, unskilled men can make the
parts.</p>

<p>From a metallurgical standpoint a die-casting is superior to a sand-casting
on account of its density, strength and freedom from blow-holes.
Also, when the hot metal comes in contact with the cool dies, it forms
a “skin” similar to the scale on an iron sand-casting. As the die-casting
requires no machining after leaving the dies, this skin increases the
wearing qualities of the casting.</p>

<p>The possibilities of die-casting are numerous. By this method of
manufacturing it is possible and practical to cast pieces that could not
possibly be machined. It is an every-day occurrence to make castings
with inserted parts of another metal, as, for instance, a zinc wheel with
a steel hub. It is also possible to make babbitt bearings that are harder
and better than can be made in any other way. Often there are two or
more parts of a device that have formerly been made separately, machined
and assembled, that can be die-cast as one piece. In such cases
the saving in production is very great. Figures and letters may be
cast sunken or in relief on wheels for counting or printing, and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
course ornamentation may be cast on pieces that require exterior finish.
As to size, there is no definite limit to the work that can be cast.
One job that is being done at the present time is a disk 16 inches in
diameter with a round flange 1 inch in diameter, around the rim.</p>

<div id="Fig_3" class="figcenter" style="width: 489px;">
  <img src="images/i_006.jpg" width="489" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 3. Examples of Die-castings</div></div>

<p>“There is no great gain without some small loss,” is just as true of
a process like die-casting as it is of anything else. The limitations
of this work are few, however, and they are here given so as to state
the situation fairly. Generally speaking, a part should not be considered
for die-casting if there are but few pieces required, because the
cost of the dies would usually be prohibitive. Often, however, it happens
that because of the large amount of accurate machine work being
done on a machine part, it is economical to make a die for the comparatively
small number of parts required and die-cast them. A case
illustrating this phase of the matter recently occurred in actual practice.
In getting out an order of two hundred vending machines, it
was decided to try die-casting on a part that was difficult to machine.
The dies were expensive, costing $200, and as there were only 200 pieces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
to be cast, the die cost per piece was one dollar; but even with that
initial handicap, it was found that on account of the difficult machining
that had formerly been required, the die-cast parts effected a large
saving, and of course the results were superior.</p>

<p>A rough part that would require little or no machining should not be
die-cast, because pound for pound, the die-casting metals cost more than
cast iron or steel. The casting machine cannot make parts as rapidly
or of as hard metals as the punch press or the automatic screw machine.
For this latter reason a part that necessarily must be made of brass,
iron or steel, cannot be die-cast, although mixtures approximately equal
in strength to iron and brass are readily die-cast. To give added
strength to a die-cast part it is often advisable to add webs and ribs or
to insert brass or iron pins at points that are weak or subject to hard
wear. Roughly speaking, it is the part that has required a good deal
of accurate machine operations that shows the greatest difference in
cost when die-cast, and sometimes the saving is as great as 80 per
cent.</p>

<h3>The Metals used in Die Casting</h3>

<p>The metals that produce the best die-castings are alloys of lead, tin,
zinc, antimony, aluminum and copper, and the bulk of the die-castings
made at the present time are mixtures of the first four of these metals.
From them, compositions may be made that will meet the requirements
of nearly any part.</p>

<p>For parts that perform little or no actual work, save to “lend their
weight,” such as balance weights, novelties and ornaments for show
windows, etc., a mixture consisting principally of lead, often stiffened
with a little antimony, is used. There is but little strength to this
metal, but it is used because of its weight and low cost. For parts that
are subject to wear, such as phonograph, telephone, gas-meter and
adding machine parts, an alloy composed of zinc, tin and a small
amount of copper is used. This alloy may be plated or japanned, and is
a good metal to use on general work.</p>

<p>Another metal, used chiefly for casting pieces that have delicate
points in their design but are not subjected to hard wear, consists principally
of tin alloyed with lead and zinc to suit the requirements of the
work. This mixture casts freely, and the finished castings come out
exceptionally clean. Still another metal, used chiefly for casting pieces
that have letters and figures for printing, is similar to the standard
type metal&mdash;5 parts lead and 1 part antimony; but if there are teeth
cast on the sides of the printing wheel a harder mixture will be required
to give longer life to the gears.</p>

<p>The following mixtures are typical of die-casting or “white brass”
alloys: copper, 10 parts; zinc, 83 parts; aluminum, 2 parts; tin, 5 parts.
Another is copper, 6 parts; zinc, 90 parts; aluminum, 3 parts; tin, 1
part. Another containing antimony is copper, 5 parts; zinc, 85 parts;
tin, 5 parts; antimony, 5 parts. Shonberg’s patented alloy is copper, 3
parts; zinc, 87 parts; tin, 10 parts. Alloys containing 15 to 40 per
cent copper and 60 to 85 per cent zinc are brittle, having low strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
and low ductility. An alloy of 8 per cent copper, 92 per cent zinc has
greater resilience and strength but not the ductility of cast zinc.</p>

<p>Aluminum may be cast, but it is a difficult metal to run into thin
walls and fine details; it plays, however, an important part in some
good mixtures used for die casting. Experiments are now being conducted
for die-casting manganese bronze, and it is said that some very
good castings have already been made. Its wearing qualities are so
valuable that it is particularly desirable for making die-castings.</p>

<h3>The Die-casting Machine</h3>

<p>The three important requisites for good die-casting are the machine,
the dies and the metal. The casting machine is fully as essential as
either of the other requisites, and although there are a number of
different styles of casting machines in use, each of which has its
advantages over the others, especially in the eyes of their respective
designers, the fundamental principles upon which they all operate are
the same. In each there is the melting pot and the burner, the cylinder
and the piston for forcing the metal into the dies, and the dies with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the opening and closing device. In some machines pressure is applied
to the metal by hand, in others power is used, and in still another class
the metal is forced into the dies with compressed air. The provisions
for opening and closing the dies vary in the different machines; there
are various means employed for cutting the sprue, and the styles of
heaters are numerous.</p>

<p>One or two of the largest firms in the die-casting industry have
automatic casting machines for turning out duplicate work in large
quantities very rapidly. These machines are complicated and are only
profitable on large quantities of work, and for that reason their use
is not extensive. In general, their operating principles are the same
as in the case of the hand machines, but provision is made for automatically
opening and closing the dies, compressing the metal, and
ejecting the castings.</p>

<h3>The Soss Die-casting Machine</h3>

<p>The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured and sold by the Soss
Manufacturing Co., Brooklyn, N.&nbsp;Y., was the first die-casting machine
to be placed on the open market. This machine is shown in <a href="#Fig_4">Figs. 4</a> and
<a href="#Fig_5">5</a>, and in section in <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>. The Soss Manufacturing Co. originally
manufactured invisible hinges exclusively. At the advent of the die-casting
era, they commenced to make these hinges from die-castings,
and placed orders with a leading die-casting concern amounting to
thousands of dollars each year. After the die-cast hinges had been on
the market for a short time, complaints commenced to come in, some
to the effect that the hinges were breaking and others that the hinges
were corroding. Either of these faults was serious enough to blast
the reputation of the hinge, but the first trouble, breakage, was the
more important. Examination of the broken hinges showed that the
castings were porous and full of flaws, and as the makers of the castings
could not produce castings sufficiently strong for the hinges, Mr.
Soss started to experiment for himself. This experimenting led to the
production of the Soss die-casting machine.</p>

  <img src="images/i_008.jpg" width="486" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 4. General View of the Soss Die-casting Machine</div></div>

<p>Referring to the illustrations <a href="#Fig_5">Figs. 5</a> and <a href="#Fig_6">6</a>, <i>A</i> is the base and frame
of the machine, <i>B</i> is the heating chamber located at one end of the
machine, and within this heating chamber is the tank <i>C</i>, shown in
<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>. This tank contains the metal from which the die-castings are
made, and the metal is heated by the burners <i>D</i>. These burners are fed
by air and gas through piping on the side of and beneath the furnace.
To facilitate lighting the burners and inspecting their condition at
any time, there is an opening (not shown) through the firebrick lining
of the furnace and the outer iron wall, on a level with the top of the
burners. There is also another opening through the furnace wall to
allow the gases due to the combustion to escape. Through the bottom
of the tank, well to the inner side of the furnace, runs the cylinder <i>E</i>.
Below the bottom of the tank, the cylinder makes a right-angle turn,
extending through the furnace wall and terminating just outside of the
wall. The orifice of this cylinder is controlled by gate <i>F</i>. In that
part of the cylinder that extends upward into the tank, there is an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
opening <i>G</i> that allows the molten metal to run into the cylinder from
the tank. Working in this cylinder, is the piston <i>H</i>, that is used in
forcing the metal into the dies. The compression lever <i>I</i>, hinged over
the inner furnace wall, is kept normally raised by spring pressure, and
is connected to the piston by means of the link <i>J</i>.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 5. Working Parts of the Soss Die-casting Machine</div></div>

<p>At the opposite end of the machine from the furnace, is the mechanism
for operating the dies. This mechanism consists of a pair of
square rods <i>K</i>, upon which are mounted the sleeves <i>L</i>. These sleeves
have a long bearing surface and are attached to the die-plate <i>M</i>. Lever
<i>N</i> at the end of the operating mechanism controls the movement of
these sleeves by means of links <i>O</i>. Upon these sleeves is mounted a
secondary set of sleeves <i>P</i>, attached to the other die-plate <i>Q</i>, and whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
movement is controlled by lever <i>R</i>, through links <i>S</i>. This second set
of sleeves is free to travel with the first set, and in addition has an
independent movement of its own on the primary sleeves. It is the
function of lever <i>R</i> to bring die-plate <i>Q</i> up to die-plate <i>M</i> by means
of links <i>S</i> and sleeves <i>P</i>; and it is the function of lever <i>N</i> to bring
both of the die-plates up to the outlet of the cylinder by means of links
<i>O</i> and sleeves <i>L</i>. This system of sleeve-mounting is one of the distinctive
patented features of the Soss machine. The orifice of the
cylinder <i>E</i> is conical in shape and exactly fits the cup-shaped opening
in die-plate <i>M</i>, so that when the two are brought together, the joint is
metal tight. At the center of this opening, and extending through the
die-plate <i>M</i>, is an opening that leads to the dies mounted on the inner
faces of the two die-plates, and a continuation of this opening extends
through die-plate <i>Q</i> in which the sprue-cutter <i>U</i> works. Attached to
the outer side of this die-plate are two slotted brackets. In the slot of
one of these is pivoted the lever <i>T</i>, and in the slot in the opposite
bracket are bolted two stops that limit the motion of the lever. This
lever operates the sprue cutter <i>U</i>, that works through the opening in
die-plate <i>Q</i>. The sprue-cutting mechanism is best shown in <a href="#Fig_6">Figs. 5</a>
and <a href="#Fig_6">6</a>. At the left of <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a> may be seen a rubber hose connected to
the air piping. This hose is used for cleaning out the dies after each
casting operation.</p>

<h3>Operation of the Die-casting Machine</h3>

<p>The metal for the die-casting machine is mixed in the proper proportions
for the work in hand by means of a separate furnace, before
being poured into the tank of the machine itself. The burners are
lighted and the dies are set up on the two die-plates. As soon as the
machine has “warmed up,” so that the metal is in a thoroughly melted
condition, the sprue-cutting lever <i>T</i> is thrown back, leaving a clear
passageway to the die cavities. Lever <i>R</i> is pulled backward, thus
bringing die-plate <i>Q</i> up to die-plate <i>M</i>, which operation closes the two
halves of the die. Then lever <i>N</i> is thrown forward, thereby bringing
the closed die up to the body of the machine, with the nozzle in close
contact with the outlet of the cylinder. Next, the gate <i>F</i> is opened, and
the man at the compression lever <i>I</i> gives the lever a quick, hard pull,
forcing the metal in the cylinder downward and into the dies. The
molten metal literally “squirts” into the dies. Gate <i>F</i> is now closed;
lever <i>N</i> is pulled back to remove the dies from the cylinder outlet; and
the sprue-cutting lever <i>T</i> is pushed forward, cutting off the sprue and
pushing it out of the nozzle into the kettle placed beneath it. The
lever <i>R</i> is pushed forward, and a finished casting is ejected from the
dies.</p>

<p>An important advantage that this machine has over other die-casting
machines is the fact that the metal for the castings is taken from the
<em>bottom</em> of the melting pot, whereas most other machines use metal from
the top of the tank. At the bottom of the tank the metal is always the
best, as it is free from impurities and dross; hence, there is little
chance for the formation of blow-holes. A handful of rosin thrown into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the melting tank occasionally helps to keep the metal clean, but the
metal nearest the surface always contains more or less foreign matter.</p>

<div id="Fig_6" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_012.jpg" width="600" height="360" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 6. Section of Soss Die-casting Machine</div></div>

<p>While this description of the operation of the die-casting machine
may convey the idea that the process is a slow one, as a matter of
fact, the time required is, on the average, not over a minute and a half
for turning out a finished casting. With the ejection of the casting
from the dies, the product is completed, in theory; but in practice there
are always a few small thin fins, caused by the air vents or by improperly
fitted portions of the dies. It is, however, but the work of a
few seconds to break off these fins, and unless there are many of them,
or they are excessively thick, they are detrimental neither to the quality
nor the quantity of finished castings.</p>

<h3>Points on the Operation of the Die-casting Machine</h3>

<p>We have now taken up the description and general operation of the
die-casting machine, but like every other machine, there are numerous
little kinds and practices in its working the observing of which makes
the difference between good and poor die-casting. Some of these points
are here given.</p>

<p>The casting machine is best operated by three men, one of whom
attends to the compression lever and the metal supply in the tank. The
other two men stand on each side of the die-end of the machine, and
it is their duty to operate the sprue-cutter, open the dies and remove
the finished casting, clean the dies with air and close them, throw back
the die-plates to their casting position over the cylinder outlet, and do
any other work incident to the operation of the machine. While it
requires three men to operate a die-casting machine in the best manner,
the man who attends to the compression lever has a good deal of spare
time between strokes, and if two or even three of the machines are
conveniently placed, one man can easily pull levers for all three.</p>

<p>The metal should be kept just above the melting point and at a
uniform temperature. If the metal is worked too cold, the result will
manifest itself in castings that are full of seams and creases, and it
will be difficult to “fill” the thin places in the dies. If, on the other
hand the metal is allowed to get too hot, the die will throw excessively
long fins, the castings will not cool as quickly in the die, and
consequently they cannot be made as rapidly. On account of the importance
of keeping the metal at a uniform heat, the fresh metal that
is added to that in the tank from time to time, is kept heated in a
separate furnace. Therefore, when the metal in the tank gets low, the
new supply does not reduce the temperature of the metal being worked.
Some casters use a thermometer to indicate the heat of the metal.</p>

<p>Casting-dies require lubrication frequently. Just how often they
should be lubricated depends on the shape of the die, the composition
of the casting metal, and the general performance of the dies. Beeswax
is the common lubricant, and the lubrication consists in merely
rubbing the cake over the surfaces of the dies that come in contact
with the casting metal. In die-casting large parts, the dies must be
kept cool by some artificial means, for hot dies are conducive to slow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
work and poor castings. To reach this end, large dies are sometimes
drilled and piped so that water may be circulated through them to
keep them cool.</p>

<p>In the Soss machine, the burners are so placed that the metal in the
cylinder is kept at a slightly higher heat than that in the tank proper.
This condition is brought about by having the cylinder directly over
the burners. The value of this feature lies in the fact that gas is not
wasted in heating the entire tank full of metal to this higher heat, but
still the metal under compression is at the required temperature. The
gas consumption of the average die-casting machine is about 100 cubic
feet per hour.</p>

<p>The speed at which die-castings may be produced varies with the size
of the castings being made, the composition of the metal being cast,
and the style of dies that must be employed. In many cases, in die-casting,
separate brass or steel pieces are used, that must be placed in the
dies before each operation so that they will be inserted in and become
a part of the finished casting. The dies may be difficult of operation
on account of draft problems or pins and screws that must be inserted
in the dies and removed from each casting before another can be made.
These different types of dies will be more fully described in the next
chapter. Taken as a whole, from ten to sixty pieces per hour are
the maximum limits for speed in die-casting, and with a well-working
die, of simple construction, a speed of forty pieces per hour is considered
good production. It is possible, however, when the castings
to be produced are small in size and simple in shape, to gate a number
of them together, or rather to construct the dies so that six or more
castings may be made at once. By this means it is often possible
to cast five or six thousand pieces per day of ten hours, on a hand
die-casting machine.</p>

<span class="subhead">MAKING DIES FOR DIE-CASTING MACHINES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The making of casting-dies calls for ingenuity and skill of the
highest order on the part of the die-maker. There is probably no class
of die-making in which the work produced is more faithful to the dies,
both in showing up the little details in the making that reflect credit
on the dies, and in exposing the defects and shortcomings in the workmanship,
if there be any. The castings from casting-dies or molds as
they are sometimes called, may be produced in dimensions down to
ten-thousandths for accuracy if necessary, and once the dies are made
the castings will not vary in the slightest degree, if the working conditions
are kept uniform.</p>

<p>In spite of the close work required in making casting-dies, the work
is very fascinating. Perhaps it is on account of this accuracy; possibly
it is on account of the fact that they are made from machine steel;
but most likely it is because there are no hardening troubles to be
contended with. Another factor that makes the work interesting is the
ingenuity required in the work, for almost every die-maker, if he is
worthy of the name, likes to figure out and plan for the best way of
building a die for a difficult job.</p>

<h3>General Principles of Casting-die Making</h3>

<p>Casting-dies, or molds, have little in common with sand molds. It
is true that the dies for die-casting are composed of two parts corresponding
to the cope and nowel of the sand mold, but they are so
different in every other way that no benefit would result from a comparison.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, casting-dies are made of machine steel; the parts
which are exceptions are the heavy bases and frames, which are made
of cast iron, and the dowel pins and small cores, usually made of tool
steel. Except in rare instances, there are no hardened parts about a
casting-die; this is the case because the melting points of some of the
alloys that are die-cast are high enough to draw the temper from any
hardened parts of the dies.</p>

<p>The ideal die is simple in construction, with as few parts as practicable;
the castings should be easily ejected and should come from the
dies as nearly free from fins as possible. To meet these requirements
in the best way is the proposition that confronts the ingenuity of the
die-maker. As the die is primarily in two parts, there must be a
parting line on the casting. This line is always placed at the point
that will permit the casting to be ejected from the dies in the easiest
manner possible, bearing in mind the effect the joint will have on the
appearance of the finished casting; this is a point far less important
than with sand casting, for, if the dies are properly made this seam will
be barely perceptible. When it is practicable to do so, it is wise to have
the parting line come on an edge of the die-casting. Draft is unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
on the straight “up-and-down” places, but of course it is impossible
to draw any parts that are undercut. Means must be provided for
ejecting the casting from the dies after completion and it is usually
done by means of ejector pins, though frequently it is better to have
the bottom of the die or some other section movable and do the ejecting
on the same principle that is used on drawing dies of the compound
type. On close work, shrinkage plays an important part, and the amount
of shrinkage varies from 0.002 to 0.007 of an inch per inch. Aluminum
shrinks the greatest amount, Parsons white brass shrinks considerably,
while tin shrinks but little.
Thus, it may be easily seen
that to figure the shrinkage
allowance for an alloy that
contains three or four metals
with different shrinkages,
requires judgment. To prevent
the air from “pocketing,”
air vents are necessary
at frequent intervals around
the die-cavity. These vents
are made by milling a flat
shallow cut from the die-cavity
across the face of the
die to the outside edges of
the block. From ¼ inch to ½ inch is the usual width and from 0.003
to 0.005 of an inch, the customary depth, varying with the size and
shape of the die in question.</p>

  <img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="600" height="460" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 7. Disk cast in Simple Casting-die</div></div>

<p>The dies or molds for die-casting are of various styles, as are also
punch-press dies, and it would be difficult to lay down specific rules
for their classification. There are the plain dies, without complications
of any kind; slide dies with one or more slides; dies for bearings, both
of the “half-round” and of the “whole-round” types; dies for gated
work; and many other less important classes. Then there are dies that
have features that belong to more than one of these types, so that it
is easily seen that to decide upon the style of die that would be best
for a given piece of work requires a good deal of experience. Some of
the most important of these types can best be shown by illustrating dies
made in the various styles, showing, step by step, how the dies are made
and assembled. To begin with, consider the making of a casting-die
of the very simplest form.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a> is shown a plain flat disk made by die-casting. In actual
practice, a die would not be made for such a simple piece, unless there
were some features about it that would prevent it being made on a
screw machine or with press tools. It might have a cam groove cut
in one of its flat sides, the sides might be covered with scroll work,
there might be gear teeth around its circumference, or a hundred and
one other conditions to make die-casting a desirable method of manufacturing.
All these complications are omitted for the sake of simplifying
this initial description of a casting-die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<div id="Fig_8" class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
  <img src="images/i_017.jpg" width="391" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 8. Simple Casting-die for Casting Block shown in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a></div></div>

<p><a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a> shows the die for this piece in plan and sectional elevation.
<i>A</i> is a square cast-iron frame, made from a single casting. This frame
or box, as it is generally called, is planed on the top and bottom only.
Next, the two die-halves <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are shaped up from machine steel.
In this casting-die, and in the majority of others, these die blocks are
square. The lower half of the die <i>B</i> is held to the cast-iron frame by
fillister head screws, set in counterbored holes, thus sinking the screw-heads
under the surface of the block. The upper half of the die <i>C</i> is
located upon <i>B</i> by dowel pins driven into <i>B</i> which have a sliding fit in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the reamed holes in <i>C</i>. This being done, the die-half <i>B</i> is fixed to the
faceplate of the lathe and the recess bored for the die-cavity. This
operation is a simple one in this case, for it is merely a straight hole
one-half inch deep and three inches in diameter. Of course this recess
must be carefully finished with a tool that has been stoned up to a sharp
edge, using lard oil. Emery cloth should be used as little as possible.
It is unnecessary to give this hole draft, but it must be free from ridges
or marks that would prevent the casting from being pushed out. If the
faces of the dies are spotted with a small piece of box wood or rawhide
held in the drill press and kept charged with flour emery, the die-casting
will reproduce this “bird’s-eye” finish and the appearance will well
repay the few minutes additional time that it will take. The spotting
should be done with dry emery (without oil) to get the brightest finish.
The upper die-half <i>C</i> is simply ground on its working face. The outside
corners and edges of the faces of both die-halves should be well rounded
off so as to insure the absence of slight dents or rough places that
might prevent the dies from fitting perfectly.</p>

<p>The ejecting mechanism must next be considered. Lever <i>D</i>, pivoted
from bracket <i>E</i>, has a steel pin <i>F</i> that engages in the elongated hole
in bracket <i>G</i>, so that an upward pull of the lever <i>D</i> raises bracket <i>G</i>,
which is attached to ejector-pin plate <i>H</i>. This plate is a loose fit over
the guide screws <i>I</i> that are attached to the lower die-half <i>B</i>. The
ejector pins <i>J</i>, four in number, in this die, are riveted into the ejector-pin
plate, and they work through holes drilled and reamed through the
lower die-half. The ends of these pins must be finished off so as to lie
perfectly flush with the inside of the die when ready for operation and,
of course, they must be a sliding fit in the holes in the die.</p>

<p>An important feature of a casting-die is the sprue cutter, shown in
this die at <i>K</i>. If the disk for which this die was made, had had a hole
or central opening of any kind, the sprue cutter would best be operated
at that point; but, as this disk is plain, the sprue cutter must be placed
at the edge. At the outside of the die-cavity, as shown in <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>, the
opening for the sprue cutter is laid out, drilled and filed to shape.
It is obvious that the side of the sprue cutter adjacent to the die must
fit the outline of the die perfectly, so that there will be no break in
the appearance of the casting. The opening for it is extended through
the upper die-half, and from a point ¼ of an inch from the inside face
of the die this hole is flared out nearly as large as the opening through
the die-plate of the machine. Of course the apperture in the upper die-half
must be no larger than the opening through the die-plate; otherwise
the sprue could not be pushed out. The sprue cutter itself is a
long rod, whose section is of the same shape and size as the openings
just made, and it is connected to the sprue cutting mechanism of the
machine. Of course it is unnecessary to shape the entire length of
the sprue cutter to size; after the working end is milled to shape for a
distance of six or eight inches, the rest of the rod may be left round.
The sprue cutter is finished first, after which both the openings in the
die are fitted to it; and while the fit should be metal tight, it must be
perfectly free to slide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
The dies are mounted on the die-plates of the casting machine by
means of straps, much the same as bolsters are held on punch press
beds. The position of the die on the die-plate must be such that the
opening for the sprue cutter will line up with the nozzle at the outlet
of the cylinder. At the time of casting, the position of the sprue cutter
is as shown in the illustration of this die, <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>. In this position there
is room for the metal to enter the die-cavity, and yet there is but a
small amount of metal to be cut off and pushed back after the die has
been filled with metal.</p>

<p>With slight modifications, the above style of die may be used for die-casting
any piece that will draw or pull out of a two-part die. If holes
must be cast through the piece, it is only necessary to add core pins to
the lower die <i>B</i>, a point that will be more fully described later. It is
unnecessary to add that both halves of the die may be utilized in
making the cavity for the die, should they be needed. Also, it is often
easier to machine out the recess larger than is needed, and set in
pieces in which parts of the outline of the die-casting have been formed.
Gear teeth are put in the die in this way; a broach is cut similar to the
gear desired, then hardened and driven through a piece of steel plate
which is afterward fitted to its place in the die.</p>

<h3>Slide Dies</h3>

<p>The die illustrated in <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a> is one of the most successful of the
various types of casting-dies, and if properly made is an interesting
piece of die work. The principal use of this particular style of die,
called a slide die, is to cast parts like the one shown in <a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>, which
is a disk similar to the one which the last die described was to cast,
except that it has raised letters at the edge and a hole in the center.
It is obvious that the die last described, (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>), would not do for
disks or other pieces having projections or depressions around their
edges, as, for instance, printing or counting wheels with raised or
sunken characters, or grooved pulleys. Briefly, this style of die is
similar to the simple casting-die, except that slides are provided, to the
required number, which form the edge of the casting. A die for a plain
grooved pulley would require but two slides, while a die for a printing
wheel with forty letters around its edge would necessitate forty slides,
one for each of the letters. The die about to be described, shown in
<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>, was made to cast a wheel with six raised letters.</p>

<p>Referring to <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>, <i>D</i> is the cast-iron box or frame, <i>E</i>, the lower die,
and <i>F</i> the upper die. In making the lower die-half, the stock is first
shaped to size and doweled to the blank for the upper die-half, and the
holes for attaching to the frame are drilled. For the sake of clearness,
these holes and screws are omitted from the illustration as are also
the vents, since they have been fully explained. The lower die is next
strapped to a faceplate, trued up, and bored out nearly to the diameter
of the body of the piece to be cast, exclusive of the raised letters. The
depth of this recess is equal to the thickness of the printing wheel plus
3/16 inch to allow for the cam ring <i>G</i> that is used to reciprocate the
slides of the die. The cam ring is made large enough to cover the die-cavity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
as well as the slides that surround it, with an allowance of an
inch or two for the cam slots <i>H</i>. The six slides <i>I</i> are made long enough
to have good bearing surfaces. With the size of the cam ring determined,
the die is next bored out to receive this cam ring and the last
inch of the recess is carried down to the depth of the die cavity so as
to make an ending space for the slots that the slides are to work in. The die is now taken from the faceplate and the slots for the slides
laid out.</p>

<div id="Fig_9" class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">
  <img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="437" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 9. Slide Die for Casting the Printing Wheel shown in <a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a></div></div>

<p>These slots may be milled or shaped, but milling is to be preferred.
The next step is the making and fitting of the slides, which are of
machine steel, having a good sliding fit in the slots. The six slides are
fitted in position and left with the ends projecting into the die proper.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
The slots <i>H</i> are next profiled in the cam ring <i>G</i>, and the pins <i>J</i> that
work in them are made and driven into the holes in the slides. With
the slides and cam ring in place, the cam ring is rotated to bring all
the slides to their inner position where they are held temporarily by
means of the cam ring and temporary screws. The die-half with the
slides thus clamped in the inner or closed position, is set up on the
lathe faceplate and the die-cavity indicated up and bored out to the
finish size, which operation also finishes the ends of the slides to the
proper radius. The die may now be taken down and the slides removed
to engrave the letters upon their concave ends. The engraving can be
done in the best manner on a Gorton engraving machine, but if such a
machine is not available they may be cut in by hand. Stamping should
never be resorted to for putting in the letters, because the stock displacement
would be so great that it would be impossible to refinish the
surface to its original condition. Before fitting the cam ring, an opening
must be milled in the
die to allow the handle to
be rotated the short distance
necessary. After the cam
ring has been fitted, it is
held in by the four small
straps <i>K</i>, attached by screws
to the lower die-half at the
corners.</p>

<div id="Fig_10" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="600" height="459" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 10. Printing Wheel cast in a Slide Die</div></div>

<p>The sprue cutter, which is
not shown, is operated
through the hole in the
center of the piece and is,
of course, round in this
die. Its action is the same
as was the one previously described, and the ejecting device
is similar, with the exception that the brackets <i>L</i> that are attached to
the ejector-pin plate M, are widely separated so as to make room for the
sprue cutter that works through a hole in the plate <i>M</i>.</p>

<h3>Die for Casting with Inserted Pieces</h3>

<p>For making die-castings that are to have pieces of another metal
inserted, it is necessary to have a die with provisions for receiving the
metal blank and holding it firmly in position while the metal is being
cast around it, and of course the piece must be held in such a manner
that it can be easily withdrawn from the die with the finished casting.</p>

<p>The die illustrated in <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a> is for a part that is used as a swinging
weight, shown in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>. The upper part of the piece is made from a
sheet steel punching, so as to lighten this part of the piece as well as
to give increased strength, especially at the hole at the pivoted end of
the work. The cast portion of the piece is slotted lengthwise, as the
illustration shows; and three holes pass through the casting, piercing
the sides of the slot. In addition to showing the method of making dies
for inserted pieces, this die shows the principles of simple coring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<div id="Fig_11" class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;">
  <img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 11. Casting-die for Making Castings with Inserted Pieces like
that shown in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a></div></div>

<p>In making this die, two machine-steel blanks are planed up for the
upper and lower halves of the die, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, the lower die being made
nearly twice as thick as the upper die because it is in this part that
the most of the die-cavity will be made. In this lower half of the die
the stock is milled out to the same shape as the outline of the plan
view of the casting, being carried down to the exact depth of the thickness
of the casting. From the wide end of this recess the stock is
milled or shaped out in a parallel slot to the outside of the die-block.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
At the bottom of the side of this wide slot are T-slots to guide the
slide <i>E</i> that is to work in this opening. The side is milled and fitted
to the T-slots and opening in the die, but is left considerably longer
than the finish size. Next, the slide is mounted on the faceplate of a
lathe and turned out on the end with the proper radius and a tongue
to form the slot that is to be in the curved end of the casting. At the
outer end of the slide is left a lug that is drilled and tapped for the
operating lever <i>F</i> that reciprocates the slide, using the stud in bracket
<i>K</i> as a fulcrum.</p>

<p>Two pieces of machine steel are next shaped and finished up to
form the chamfered part of the casting and to locate the inserted steel
punching in the die. The combined thickness of these pieces <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>
is equal to the thickness of the casting, less the thickness of the inserted
piece. It is now an easy
matter to seat section <i>D</i> in the
bottom of the milled part of the
lower die-half, and to locate
section <i>C</i> in its proper position
on the upper half. A pilot pin
<i>M</i> is fitted in <i>D</i> to hold the
steel punching in position by
means of the hole that is in the
extreme upper end of the
punching. The pilot pin extends
through this hole into a corresponding
hole in section <i>C</i>.
At the lower end of the steel
part that is inserted, there are
two holes the object of which is to secure the punching to the die-casting,
for the molten metal runs through these holes, practically
riveting the die-casting to the inserted piece.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 12. Die-cast Weight with Inserted
Sheet-steel Punching</div></div>

<p>Provision has now been made for holding the sheet-metal part that is
to be inserted, and the cavity has been completed for the casting, including
the tongue at the end; it now remains to describe the manner
of forming the holes that pierce the casting through the slotted portion.
In the lower die-half the positions of the three holes <i>H</i> are
laid out, drilled and reamed. Then, with the two die-halves together
and the slide clamped at its inner position, the holes are transferred
through the slide and the upper die. This being done, it is an easy
matter to make core pins and drive them into the upper die at the two
end holes, the center hole being taken care of by the sprue cutter <i>L</i>
that will be described later. The core pins should be a nice sliding fit
through the slide and in the holes in the lower die, into which they
should extend from a quarter to half an inch. In addition to coring
the holes, these pins act as a lock to hold the slide <i>E</i> in its proper
position at the time of casting.</p>

<p>The sprue cutter <i>L</i> is most conveniently operated in the center
hole, thus doing away with the core pin that would otherwise be required.
The sprue cutter needs little description in this die, for as in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the slide die, it is merely a plain round rod that fits closely in the
holes through the dies and slide. The ejector mechanism is the same
in this die as in the dies already described; therefore further description
is unnecessary.</p>

<div id="Fig_13" class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">

  <div class="caption">Fig. 13. Casting-die for the Half-round Bearing shown in <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a></div></div>

<p>The operation of this die is very simple. The sheet-steel piece is
laid in the recess in the open die, being located by the pin <i>M</i>. Slide
<i>E</i> is thrown in by means of lever <i>F</i>, and the dies are closed. At the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
time of casting, the sprue cutter in is the position shown in the sketch,
being nearly through the die-cavity. As before explained, this
position admits the molten metal to pass into the die-cavity, but still
leaves very little sprue to be cut off after the die-casting is completed.
It should be stated that the steel piece that is inserted must be perfectly
flat and free from burrs that would prevent the die-halves from
coming together properly.</p>

<h3>Bearing Dies</h3>

<p>Bearing dies are one of the most important of the various classes of
casting-dies. The bearings produced by die-casting are so far superior
to those made by other casting methods and machining that their use
is now very extensive. Dies are made for “half-round” and “whole-round”
bearings. There is little out of the ordinary about a whole-round
die, but the half-round die involves many interesting methods
of die-making, and for that reason is here described.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a> shows a casting-die for half-round bearings. Half-round bearing
dies are usually made to cast two bearings at a time, for the
reason that it is just as easy to cast two pieces of such a shape as it
is to cast one, and, in addition, the die is balanced in a better manner.
As with other dies, the first step is to machine up the frame <i>A</i> and the
two die-halves <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>. The pieces <i>D</i> and <i>E</i> that are to form the
insides of the bearings are then turned up and one side of each shaped
and keyed to fit the slots that have previously been milled in die-half
<i>C</i>. These parts are held in place by dowels and screws. One of the
bearings produced by this die is shown in <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>, and it will be
noticed that there is an oil groove within that covers the length of
the bearing. To produce this groove in the die-castings, a shell must
be turned up and bored out whose inside diameter is that of the inside
of the bearing, and whose thickness equals the depth of the oil groove.
This being done, the oil grooves are laid out upon the shell and cut
out by drilling and filing. After rounding the outside corners, these
little strips are pinned to the cores <i>D</i> and <i>E</i> in their proper places.</p>

<div id="Fig_14" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="600" height="168" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 14. Die-cast Half-round Bearing, Showing the Cast Oil Grooves</div></div>

<p>Another little kink in this connection is worthy of noting. So many
different styles and sizes of bearings are made by a concern doing much
die-casting that it is essential that the die-cast bearings should bear
some distinguishing number to identify them. As this number is of no
consequence to the user it is well to have the number in an inconspicuous
place, but it must be where it will not be effaced by scraping,
etc. Bearing in mind that it is much easier to produce raised lettering
by die-casting than to produce sunken lettering, it will be readily seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
that the oil groove affords a good place in which to put the bearing
number. This is easily done by stamping the figures upon the narrow
strip that forms the oil groove. In this place on the bearing it may be
easily found if needed, and of course there is no danger of its being
taken out by machining.</p>

<p>The lower die consists of two blocks <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>, each of which contains
an impression of a bearing. The best way to make these parts is to
lay out the ends of each of the blocks with the proper radius, taking
care to have the center come a little below the surface of the face of
the block. Then the blocks should be shaped out to get the bulk of the
stock out, before setting up in the lathe. After the lathe work is done
on each piece, which of course is usually done separately, the faces of
the two blocks are faced down just to the exact center of the impression.
It will be noticed that two blocks are used for the lower part of
the die. The reason is to facilitate the locating of the female parts
of the die in proper relation to the male parts. After properly locating,
they may be doweled and screwed to baseplate <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>The sprue cutter <i>H</i>, better shown in the plan view, is square in
shape and connects with the die-cavities in a thin narrow opening on
either side of the sprue cutter. The ejector pins, <i>I</i>, two to each die,
are at the ends of the bearings. The ejector-pin plate <i>J</i> is necessarily
large, and is operated by lever <i>K</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">VAN WAGNER MFG. CO.’S DIE-CASTING PRACTICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In 1907, Mr. E.&nbsp;B. Van Wagner, of Syracuse, N.&nbsp;Y., established the
E.&nbsp;B. Van Wagner Mfg. Co. for the production of die-castings. The factory
comprises the office section, the machine shop where the dies and
casting machines are built, the metallurgical laboratory where the
metals are alloyed, the casting department shown in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a> where the
die-castings are made, and the trimming department.</p>

<h3>Possibilities and Limitations of Die Casting</h3>

<div id="Fig_16" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="600" height="331" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 16. Die-casting Constructions to be avoided</div></div>

<p>At the outset we may say that it is possible to die-cast almost any
piece, but it is not by any means practicable to do so. It must be
remembered that to die-cast on a practical basis the dies must be constructed
in such a manner that the cost of their operation and up-keep
will be light, or there will be no profit in die-casting. It is impracticable
to produce under-cut work, that is, work having no draft and
which is therefore impossible to draw from the die. Such an instance
is that illustrated at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>, and by the internal section of <i>M</i>,
<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>, and the internal groove in <i>O</i>, also shown in <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>. If absolutely
necessary, work of this kind can be done by the use of collapsible
cores; but here, again, we meet resistance in maintaining the dies
in proper condition, and, moreover, this method is commercially impracticable,
owing to the difficulty of operating these cores rapidly.
Hollow work, requiring curved cores, like faucets and bent piping of
the character illustrated at <i>C</i> in <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>, are difficult to produce. If,
in designing the piece, it can be planned to have the parts of such a
shape that the cores can be readily withdrawn, employing a two-piece
core with a slight draft in each direction, the division coming as indicated
by the core line of <i>C</i> in <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>, the problem becomes simpler.
Oftentimes this work can best be done by casting in a straight piece,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
afterward bending the die-casting. It does not pay to cast
rough heavy work that can be made just as efficiently by sand
casting. Generally speaking, the greatest saving can be
effected by die-casting small pieces which have previously
required a large amount of machining to produce. On large
plain work the amount of metal required for the casting
makes the cost excessive on account of the difference in cost
of the metals. If, however, the large work must be finely
finished by polishing, etc., it is oftentimes found of advantage
to die-cast. Corners, especially those joining thick and thin
sections, as at <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>, should be heavily filleted as shown
on one side of this piece. Regarding the casting of thin sections,
it is not practicable to try to cast sections under 3/64
inch in thickness, as the metal runs with difficulty into such
narrow places. A casting having walls 1/16 inch, like that
shown at <i>X</i>, <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>, is easily cast. Threaded sections,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
if the threads are fine, say, under twenty-four to the inch, should not
be die-cast, because under moderate pressure they will strip. A good
way to treat constructions of this kind is to enclose brass or steel
bushings in the die-castings in which the threads are required.</p>

<div id="Fig_17" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="600" height="237" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 17. View of the Casting Room</div></div>

<p>As to the accuracy with which die-castings may be produced, it is
possible to keep dimensions within 0.0005 inch of standard size, but to
do so requires considerable expense in keeping the dies in condition.
A limit of 0.002 inch, however, is entirely practicable, and can be maintained
easily. In specifying the accuracy with which die-castings are
to be made, only those parts which are absolutely essential should be
held to size, in order to keep the cost of the work nominal. One of the
great advantages of the use of die-castings is that no finishing is required
after the pieces leave the molds. Finish requirements should
be plainly stated in ordering die-castings, as the alloy must be suited
to these requirements.</p>

<div id="Fig_18" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="600" height="326" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 18. Methods of attaching Die-cast Gears, etc., to Shafts</div></div>

<p>Another great saving is effected on lettered work, either raised or
sunken. One of these jobs is illustrated at <i>Q</i>, <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>, which shows an
example of die-cast lettering. Sunken lettering is to be preferred to
raised lettering, as the latter is more easily injured. Knurled work
may be produced easily, if straight knurls are used, and threaded sections
over ¼ inch in size are entirely practicable, either internal or
external. External die cast threads are illustrated at <i>R</i> and <i>S</i>, <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>.
The casting of gears and segments is a familiar application of die-casting;
this is illustrated by the large gear at <i>N</i>, <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>, and the
segment at <i>W</i>, <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>, which give an idea of the general character of
this class of work. The casting of pulleys, gears, and similar parts on
shafts may be easily effected as shown by the gear on the shaft at <i>N</i>,
in <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>. The views shown in <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a> are intended to convey an
idea of three methods of die-casting around shafts. At <i>D</i> is shown a
die-casting cast around a steel shaft. If the surface of the shaft
coming within the pulley has been previously knurled, the pulley will
grip it much better, but for ordinary purposes the shrinkage of the
die-cast metal around the shaft is sufficient. If any heavy strain is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
be imposed on the work, it is better to provide anchor holes through
the shaft, like those indicated at <i>E</i>. It will be readily seen that the
die-cast metal runs through these holes in the shaft, forming rivets
which are integral with the casting. For locating levers upon the ends
of shafts, etc., a good way is to flatten opposite sides of the shaft and
cast around them, as shown at <i>F</i>, <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>. The screw seen projecting
beneath the piece at <i>Q</i>, <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>, was die-cast in place. Any of these
methods are to be recommended, and a proper knowledge of possibilities
of this kind will increase the scope of die-casting.</p>

<div id="Fig_19" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="600" height="226" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 19. A Few Possibilities of Die Casting</div></div>

<p>Another phase of die-casting which can well be borne in mind is
the possibility of inserting steel or other parts in the die-casting. Such
an instance is shown at <i>G</i> in <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>&mdash;a die-casting which was made
by the Van Wagner Co. as a part of an electrical apparatus, the steel
inserts being contact points. Oftentimes it is found advisable to include
brass bearing rings to give additional durability at points where
the die-cast metal would not stand up. The die-casting shown at <i>U</i>,
<a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>, in which the brass ring at <i>T</i> has been incorporated, is typical
of such cases. To die-cast pieces like those shown at <i>H</i> in <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>, and
similarly at <i>V</i> in <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>, having inverted conical openings, might at
first thought seem difficult, but this is entirely practicable. Similarly,
split bushings like those shown at <i>I</i>, <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>, and at <i>W</i>, <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>, may
be cast with projecting lugs for the reception of screws for clamping
upon shafts, etc., but this construction should not be used if frequent
tightening or loosening will be necessary.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 22. Die-castings which show Lettering and Thread Castings</div></div>

<p>The shrinkage problem manifests itself in die-casting in the same
measure that it does in other casting operations. Different metals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
shrink in different degrees, as will be explained later on. However, one
important point can be mentioned at this time: that is, the amount of
shrinkage is often dependent upon the shape of the piece. For instance,
pieces like those shown at <i>K</i> in <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a> or at <i>X</i> in <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>, will
shrink very little on account of the fact that the steel mold is of such
shape that the central core will prevent the die-casting from shrinking.
However, pieces like those shown at <i>L</i> in <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>, or at <i>V</i> in <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>,
which have nothing to hold them from pulling together as they
cool, will shrink to the greatest extent. All of these points must be
taken into consideration when designing work for die-casting. Practically
no draft is necessary on a die-casting, except on very deep sections,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
as indicated at <i>J</i> in <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>, where a draft of 0.001 inch to the
inch is desirable. Perfectly straight sections, however, can be cast,
as the shrinkage of the metal is usually enough to free it from the
die.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 24. Die-castings illustrating the Extremes of Shrinkage</div></div>

<p>It is the opinion of the Van Wagner Co. that die-casting costs can be
materially reduced if designers will bear this point in mind when
bringing out new designs. Even though it is often possible to cast
special pieces, incorporating several parts in one, and thereby accomplishing
what seems to be a great stunt to the designer, it is sometimes
more practicable to make the piece in several sections and later
assemble it. Not only is this simpler for the die caster, but it is also
more economical for the customer. Such points as avoiding thin sections,
including large fillets at corners, as well as taking account of
the under-cut problem, are simply matters of common sense, but they
can profitably be considered by the designer.</p>

<h3>The Van Wagner Die-casting Machine</h3>

<p>The first essential to good die-casting is a good casting machine.
Perhaps the best known types of casting machines are of the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
plunger type, of which there are several varieties, the pneumatic type
and the rotary or automatic type. (For descriptions of various types of
die-casting machines, see “Die Casting Machines,” <span class="smcap">Machinery’s</span> Reference
Book No. 108.) For the economical production of die-castings,
however, the hand-operated machines are rather too slow, and automatic
machines are applicable only to a class of work which may be
made in very large quantities. For these reasons, therefore, the Van
Wagner Co. employs the compressed air type of die-casting machine
which was patented by Mr. E.&nbsp;B. Van Wagner in 1907. In the casting
department of the Van Wagner shop, illustrated in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>, there are
installed about thirty machines. <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a> shows a die-casting
machine in the open position. <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a> shows a closer view of the die-operating
mechanism and <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a> is presented to give a general idea
of the construction of the entire machine.</p>

<div id="Fig_25" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 25. Drawing illustrating Principle of Van Wagner Die-casting
Machine</div></div>

<p>By referring to the line illustration <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>, which shows the Van
Wagner pneumatic die-casting machine in part, and comparing this
illustration with <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>, which shows the general appearance of the
die-operating and other mechanism of the casting machine, a good idea
may be obtained of its construction and working. At <i>A</i> may be seen
the base of the machine in which is located the melting pot <i>B</i>. This
melting pot is heated by means of fuel oil passing through the supply
pipe <i>C</i> to the burners <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>. A vent pipe <i>D</i> is provided to take away the
gases incident to combustion. The pressure for “shooting” the metal
into the die cavity is supplied by air through the supply pipe <i>E</i>. A
valve controls this air supply. The pressure is regulated to suit the
particular casting or die, the proper amount being determined by experiment.
Similarly, an air exhaust pipe <i>F</i>, which may be seen
directly above the supply pipe, sub-divides into two tubes which extend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
to the die cavity to exhaust the air before the metal is admitted.
There are two methods of overcoming the presence of air in
the die cavity&mdash;the exhaust method and the venting method, and it is
the former that is here described.</p>

<div id="Fig_26" class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">
  <img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="416" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 26. View of Machine showing Die-operating Mechanism</div></div>

<p>A “goose-neck” <i>G</i>, shown in <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>, serves to temporarily contain
the metal which is forced into the mold. An amount of metal
slightly in excess of that required for one die-casting is placed in this
goose-neck with a hand-ladle, previous to each operation of the machine.
One end of the goose-neck is connected to the air pipe, <i>E</i>, while the
other end terminates in the nozzle <i>G</i><sub>1</sub>. This nozzle may best be seen
by referring to the illustration of the machine shown in <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>, in
connection with <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>. One of the advantages in using this goose-neck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
is that the entire air pressure is expended upon the metal in the
goose-neck, and, by reason of its isolated position, the goose-neck and its
contents are kept slightly hotter than the contents of the melting pot.</p>

<h3>The Die-operating Mechanism</h3>

<p>The die-operating mechanism of the machine is contained within
a hinged framework, shown in position for the removal of the die-casting
in <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>. Referring to <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>, in connection with the line
illustration <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>, it will be seen that the die-holding mechanism is
all supported upon the lower die-holding plate <i>H</i>, which is hinged to
the edge of the base of the machine. A lock <i>J</i> serves to hold the dies
and operating mechanism in the upright operating position, and by
means of a counterbalance, suspended from an overhead rope which
connects with the top of the mechanism at <i>P</i>, the changing of the position
of this mechanism is easily effected, and when thrown into the
horizontal position, as indicated in <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>, it rests upon a support
while the dies are being opened and the castings ejected.</p>

<div id="Fig_27" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="600" height="421" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 27. Die-casting Machine in Position for Removal of Casting</div></div>

<p>The lower die is shown at <i>H</i><sub>1</sub> and the upper die <i>K</i><sub>1</sub> is mounted upon
the upper die-holding plate <i>K</i>. Four rods <i>L</i> act as guiding members
for the upper die-holding plate to slide upon. These rods <i>L</i> are mounted
in fixed positions at the corners of the lower die-holding plate <i>H</i>, and
at their upper ends the operating shaft supporting plate <i>M</i> is located
in a fixed position, serving to support the upper ends of these rods.
The position of this plate <i>M</i> is adjustable upon the rods by means of
check-nuts, thus providing for the accommodation of thick as well as
thin dies. A shaft <i>O</i> is supported in this top plate, and by means of
the operating lever <i>N</i> working through slotted levers <i>O</i><sub>1</sub> and links <i>O</i><sub>2</sub>,
the upper die-holding plate and die can thus be removed from contact
with the lower die at will.</p>

<p>The metal enters the die cavity through the nozzle <i>G</i><sub>1</sub> and after
setting, it is necessary to cut the sprue formed by the surplus metal that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
remains outside the die cavity. For this purpose, a sprue-cutter,
operated by means of hand-lever <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, is employed. This sprue-cutting
lever is hinged in the fulcrumed link <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub>, and is held in its casting position
by means of an adjustable stop on bracket <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>In many dies, it is necessary that water be circulated through the die-blocks
to keep them cool during the die-casting operation. In <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>,
the water pipe may be seen at <i>R</i>, and hose pipes run from this supply
to each side of the die-blocks, thus providing a cooling circulation. In
this illustration, the pipes used for exhausting the air from the die
cavity are apt to be confused with the cooling pipes, but by following
the two pipes leading vertically down to the machine, the exhaust pipes
may be seen and kept distinct from the water pipes.</p>

<h3>Making a Die-casting</h3>

<p>In order to clearly understand the operation of the die-casting machine,
let us follow the sequence of events that takes place in producing
a casting. Two men are required to operate the machine. In <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>,
the operators may be seen in their working positions. The first step
is taken by the operator at the left who, with a hand-ladle, dips enough
metal for one casting from the melting pot and pours it through nozzle
<i>G</i><sub>1</sub> into the goose-neck. The second operator in the meantime is replacing
the cores in the dies, adjusting the position of the sprue-cutter and
closing the dies preparatory to making a casting. This being done, he
elevates the dies and their operating mechanism, which are hinged and
counterbalanced, as previously described, bringing them to an upright
position. The die operator now mounts the box, raises the sprue-cutter
to its open position to admit the metal; after which the machine operator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
turns the air valve with his left hand. The operation of this air
valve admits the air behind the metal, forcing it into the die, and the
same movement opens the exhaust valve slightly in advance. The
exhaust valve is located upon the second length of piping just above
the air valve, and as a link connects the two valves, the single motion
exhausts the air from the die cavity and immediately afterward the air
is admitted behind the metal, thereby “shooting” the metal into the die.
This being done, the air is shut off and the die operator cuts the sprue
by means of lever <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, withdraws the cores in the die, throws the dies
to the open position (which is indicated in <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>), and operates the
ejecting mechanism, thus removing the casting from the die. In the
meantime, the machine operator is tending to his metal supply and
getting a ladle full of metal ready for the next die-casting operation.
By referring to the machines shown in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>, it will be noticed that
only a few are provided with exhaust piping for venting the dies.
Another venting method will be described later.</p>

  <img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="600" height="431" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 29. Trimming Die-castings on a Filing Machine</div></div>

<p>The number of die-castings which can be made on one machine per
day of ten hours varies with the character of the pieces being die-cast,
the number of pieces made at each operation of the machine and the
ease with which the dies may be worked, which depends, of course,
upon the number of cores and parts to be handled at each die-casting
operation. The dies shown in the machine in <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>, produce four
bearings at each operation.</p>

<h3>Trimming Die-castings</h3>

<p>At the end of each run the operators of the machines go over their
work, breaking the castings from the sprues and throwing out all that
are defective. No matter how carefully the die-casting molds have been
made, there is always a certain amount of trimming to be done on the
finished die-castings, on account of the crevices left in the die for air<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
vents, or which exist from improper fitting of the parts of the dies.
These “fins,” as they are called, are trimmed by hand operators in a
special department. A general view of this trimming room is shown
in <a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>. Usually it is sufficient to scrape these fins off with a scraping
knife, but if the casting is especially difficult to produce, so that a large
opening is required to admit the metal, it is sometimes necessary to
trim unusually thick sprue sections by filing. <a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a> illustrates the
method of trimming such die-castings on a filing machine.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 31. A Typical Die-casting Mold</div></div>

<h3>The Dies Used</h3>

<p>Next to the casting machine, the dies or molds are the most important
necessary factor. A general view of the Van Wagner Co.’s die-making
department is shown in <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>. In order to gain a proper
conception of the work required in producing a high-grade die-casting
mold, we will follow the different steps which are necessary in making
the mold. The first and most important step is the proper planning of
the die. Before any work at all can be done, it is necessary to plan the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
die, <i>i. e.</i>, to decide just where the parting lines will come; just what
method will be used for ejecting the piece; what alloy will be used;
where the casting will be gated; and a hundred and one minor points,
all of which have a direct bearing upon the performance of the finished
dies. All these decisions have to be made by the diemaker, and in <a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>
he is shown, micrometer in hand, computing the shrinkage allowances
that he will make in the dies. This is a very important factor on
accurate work as the shrinkage varies from 0.001 to 0.004 inch, according
to the alloy and the general shape of the piece.</p>

<div id="Fig_32" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="600" height="472" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 32. Die-casting Mold shown in <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>, disassembled</div></div>

<p>Before taking up the actual machining operations of the mold-making
as conducted in this factory, it will be well to take a typical die-casting
mold and note its general construction. <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a> shows a typical die-casting
mold closed, while <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a> shows the same mold disassembled on
the bench to show its construction. The piece for which the mold has
been made is also shown. <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a> shows a similar die in section. From
the three illustrations a good idea of an average die-casting mold can
be obtained. Referring to these illustrations, the principal parts of this
die are the ejector box <i>A</i>, and the ejector plate <i>B</i> which is operated by
the racks <i>C</i>. For operating the ejector plate, the pinion shaft <i>D</i> having
a handle suitable for turning, is furnished. This, of course, fits into a
bored hole in the ejector box, bringing the pinion into mesh with the
racks for raising the ejector plate. In the ejector plate are three ejector
pins <i>E</i> for removing the casting from the mold. The ejector pins
operate through holes <i>F</i>. Beyond the pinion shaft may be seen the
casting for which this mold has been made. It will be noticed that
the top side of the casting has three projecting lugs through which are
small holes. Provision for forming this side of the die-casting is made
in the lower half of the mold <i>G</i>, while the upper half of the die-casting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
is taken care of by the top plate <i>H</i>. One of the toggles for operating the
core pins through these three lugs is shown at <i>I</i>. These parts will be
described more fully later. The sprue cutter is shown in position in
the die at <i>J</i>.</p>

<h3>Machining the Die Cavities</h3>

<p>As will be noticed from <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>, the machinery in the die-making
department is of modern design, for no other class of work demands as
good tool equipment and as much skill in the making as die-casting
molds. The die-blocks are made of machinery steel. <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a> illustrates
the first step in making a
die-casting mold after the
die-block has been shaped
approximately to size. This
operation consists in carefully
facing off the die surfaces
on a vertical-spindle
grinding machine. This, of
course, is a quick method of
surfacing the die-block, and
it insures that the top and
bottom surfaces of these
plates will be parallel, permitting
the die-faces to come
together properly.</p>

<div id="Fig_33" class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">
  <img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="321" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 33. Section through a Die-casting Mold</div></div>

<p>The next step consists of
laying out the die, as shown
in <a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>. This is done in
the usual manner, by working
on a coppered surface,
using dividers, scales, and a
center punch. When laying
out the die, the necessary
allowances are made for
shrinkage and finish, these
points having been planned
before actual work on the
die has been started. As in
other phases of die-work,
the machining operations
are performed, as far as possible,
before any hand-work
is done. In <a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a> may be seen a die-maker turning the cavity in a
part of the die-casting mold. The highest type of skilled workmanship
is called for on this machine work, and as may be surmised from
<a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a>, where the die-maker is shown measuring the die with a vernier
caliper, the measurements must be exact, for no grinding operations
follow the machine work.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_5">Figs. 35</a> and <a href="#Fig_39">39</a> show typical milling operations being performed on
die-casting molds. In <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a> the diemaker is shown indicating a pin
in one corner of the mold cavity, preparatory to doing additional milling.
The block is held in the usual manner by being clamped on the
bed of the milling machine, and after it has been properly located under
the cutter head, tools are substituted for the indicator and the milling
of the cavity is completed. <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a> shows one of the sections of the die-casting
mold which is to be used in producing the casting shown at
the right of the work. In this case the diemaker is milling the recess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
for the steel arbor which may be seen directly in the foreground.
This will be fitted in place to provide for the forming
of the hole in the side of the piece.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 39. Indicating a Mold on the Milling Machine</div></div>

<p><a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a> illustrates several important points in the making
of a die-casting mold. This illustration shows the ejector
box with the lower half of the mold on it, the ejector<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
plate being held against the under side of the die-plate by means
of the pinion shaft. The operation being done is the drilling of
the ejector-pin holes. Referring back to <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>, which by the
way shows the die here illustrated disassembled, the holes being
drilled are those shown at <i>F</i> for the reception of the pins <i>E</i>. The
method employed is to drill the holes through the die and into the
ejector plate, afterward reaming all holes to size and driving the pins
into position in the ejector plate, while they are allowed to slide freely
through the die-plate. We will now assume that the ejector box and
plate have been completed and fitted, a pinion shaft for operating this
plate also fitted, the lower and upper dies completed by the machining
operations previously described, and all assembled. The final operation
of the fitting of the pins is shown in <a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a> in which the die-maker
may be seen filing off the ends of these pins so that when dropped
to the lower position they will lie flush with the surface. If of uneven
lengths, these pins will cause irregular spots in the casting. It now
remains to describe the toggles used for operating the cores which form
the holes through the three lugs in the casting. One of these toggles,
of which there are three, is shown at <i>I</i>, in <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>, and also in <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
These toggles consist of brackets which are attached to the die-plate,
and levers which are fulcrumed at the ends of the brackets so that
their operation works the core pins. It is necessary to remove these
core pins after each casting has been made and position them before
another casting can be produced.</p>

<div id="Fig_40" class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">
  <img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="495" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 40. Drilling the Ejector-pin Holes</div></div>

<p>The fitting of the parts of a die-casting mold is one of the most
important parts of the work. It demands the highest type of workmanship,
for a poorly fitted die means a die which works hard in
addition to producing poor castings. It is very important that all movable
parts should work freely. <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a> shows the assembling operation
on a die-casting mold, the casting which is to be duplicated being
shown in the immediate foreground. These parts must all be screwed
into their respective places, making the joints as nearly air-tight as
possible. One cause of poor die-castings arises from the trapping of
air in the die, and different methods are employed for overcoming this
trouble.</p>

<h3>Venting the Dies</h3>

<p>There are two methods of preventing air from being trapped in die-casting
molds; either by constructing the dies so that the air may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
exhausted from the mold cavity before admitting the metal, or by
venting the die so that the air may be forced out by the inrushing
metal. In the first of these methods it is necessary that the joints in
the mold be made as close as possible, otherwise it will be impossible to
produce anything like a vacuum in the mold cavity. If, however, it
has many parts which must be fitted, it is usually considered advisable
to provide the die with vents consisting of milled recesses a few thousandths
inch deep. Several vents are provided, from which the air can
escape when the metal is admitted to the dies. The hot metal, of
course, “shoots” through them in thin ribbons, but not enough escapes
to affect the pressure on the metal which goes into the casting.</p>

<div id="Fig_41" class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
  <img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="468" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 41. Fitting Ejector-pins</div></div>

<p>No matter how carefully a die may have been constructed, or how
carefully it has been assembled, there is always a certain amount of
“babying” to be done before it will work satisfactorily. The casting
may stick a little here, or there may be a rough spot there, and it is
the successful elimination of these troubles which constitutes the production
of a good die-casting.</p>

<h3>Die-casting Metals</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
One of the purposes of this book is to correct several erroneous impressions
which are prevalent in regard to die-casting possibilities.
Many people seem to think that nearly all metals can be die-cast, but as
a matter of fact, those metals which can be successfully die-cast can be
numbered on the fingers of one hand, being alloys of lead, zinc, tin,
copper and antimony. The tin base metals shrink very little, while the
zinc base metals shrink considerably, and those with a large per
cent of aluminum have a very high shrinkage. Without doubt, the
most used die-casting metals are the zinc base metals. A typical metal
of this class contains about 85 per cent zinc; 8 per cent tin; 4 per cent
copper and 3 per cent aluminum. The melting point of this metal is
about 850 degrees F. While this alloy is one of the most common,
it is not by any means the best, as there is too little tin employed, but
it is a comparatively cheap metal, which probably accounts for its large
use. This metal is easily affected by heat and cold, and rapidly deteriorates
with age. The lead base metals may be typified by
an alloy containing 80 per cent lead; 15 per cent antimony; 4 per cent
tin; and 1 per cent copper. This composition melts at approximately
550 degrees F. and is used for castings subjected to little wear and
where no great strength is required. The weight of this metal is its
greatest objection, and it is also quite brittle because of the large percentage
of antimony.</p>

<div id="Fig_42" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 42. Assembling a Die-casting Mold</div></div>

<p>For the best class of die-castings, the tin base metals are employed.
These range from 60 to 90 per cent tin, and from 2 to 10 per cent
copper, together with a little antimony. The melting point of a mixture
of this composition is about 675 degrees F. The castings have a good
color and they are much better in quality than any of the other alloys.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
It is absolutely essential that tin base metals be used for carbureter
parts or other parts coming in contact with gasoline. Also, the tin
base metals must be used for parts which come in contact with food
products, as the lead or zinc alloys have a contaminating effect.</p>

<p>Aluminum alloys have been cast in France and Germany in limited
quantities, but very seldom in this country on account of their high
melting point, as well as their effect upon the die. After aluminum
alloys have been run in the dies for a short time, the surfaces of the
molds become pitted. Through some unexplained cause, the metal seems
to flake out particles of the steel in the molds. When an aluminum
alloy is to be used, a good mixture is 80 per cent aluminum, 3 per cent
copper and 17 per cent zinc. This alloy has a high shrinkage and it
has also the same deteriorating effect upon the dies, but to a much less
degree than pure aluminum.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
